# Features

This project showcases a Speedometer built using C++ and Qt6, accompanied by a server for remote control. It includes built-in features for monitoring temperature and battery levels, as well as turn signal lights and audible alerts. In the event of a disconnection between the server and client, a warning message will promptly notify the user."

## Prerequisites

- **CMake** version 3.22 or higher
- **Qt6** with the following components: Core, Widgets, Multimedia, and SerialPort
- **PlatformIO** (for building and uploading firmware to the ESP32)

## Building

### Desktop Client and Server

To compile and run the client and server applications on the desktop:

```bash
rm -r * && cmake .. && make && ./server && ./client
```

### Firmware for ESP32
To build the firmware for the ESP32 server:

```bash
cmake --build . --target build_server_firmware
```

To upload the built firmware to the ESP32 server:

```bash
cmake --build . --target upload_server_firmware
```
To build the firmware for the ESP32 client:

```bash
cmake --build . --target build_client_firmware
```
To upload the built firmware to the ESP32 client:

```bash
cmake --build . --target upload_client_firmware
```
## Communication Protocols

By default, the TCP communication protocol is used. If you want to switch to the UART communication protocol, modify the `CMakeLists.txt`:

```bash
set(UARTCOM ON) # Switch this to ON for UART
```
## Directory Structure

- `client/desktop` - Contains the source code and headers for the desktop client application
- `server/desktop` - Contains the source code and headers for the desktop server application
- `client/esp32` - Contains the firmware code for the ESP32 client
- `server/esp32` - Contains the firmware code for the ESP32 server

## Dependencies

- **Qt6**: Used for building the GUI and handling multimedia components for both the client and server.
- **Qt6::SerialPort**: Used for UART communication when enabled.
